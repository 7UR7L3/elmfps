Now, you might ask yourself, why in the world would someone try to do something so stupid, and we ask ourselves that question every day.

If you're like lolwat, [this will probably be useful](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).
Namely, we'll try to keep a somewhat up to date .html _somewhere_ in the repo. Where? No idea. But it's there. Maybe.

As for what anything is, allow me to explain:
- [WebGL for Elm](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/webgl/latest) is actually pretty slick, and somehow (how is beyond us) appears to be quite performant. For now. Until we do something stupid and fuck it all up.
	- that link there is actually a great resource for figuring out what's what too.
- [Now this here](https://medium.com/@zenitram.oiram/a-beginners-guide-to-websockets-in-elm-and-crystal-8f510c28eb61) is (and fuck medium but whatever you get over it) something that could possibly be almost decent enough. How do we know? Well, we have no idea. It was just one of the first hits on google.
	- [The Kemal thing](http://kemalcr.com/) is probably the thing that we'll toss up on heroku and magic into something almost functional (ayy).

Trust us though, we have mad experience with this stuff.

This'll probably end having been quite inspired by ace of spades. It will also probably be rather cyan.

I apologize to our future selves.
